In wake of the statements made by the two BJP leaders, the EC reiterated its past instructions on the Model Code of Conduct to all political parties Wednesday.

Ramsher of Gonda (UP) said, he had been pulling a rickshaw in the city for past two decades but it was for the first time when he was ferrying vegetables and fruits in the rickshaw instead of passengers. Several rickshaw pullers have returned to their native place in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, but all those staying here are now, working in vegetable markets to come to terms with the circumstances,” said a rickshaw puller, MakuLal from Bihar. Krishan Lal, who rents out rickshaws informed there are, at present, more than 250 rickshaws in the district whereas a considerable number of migrants who used to pull rickshaw had returned to their native place fearing the crisis of livelihood. Those rickshaws, that usually remained parked outside the railway station, bus stand and other public places can now be seen at various vegetable markets in the city. .
