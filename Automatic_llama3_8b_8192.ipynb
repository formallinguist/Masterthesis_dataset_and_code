In his order, the judge noted that even after giving ample opportunity, the prosecution had failed to secure the presence of the 12-year-old to depose as a witness.

Context: The state government has also appointed a nodal officer to monitor the supply and demand of medical oxygen amid spiralling cases of Covid, and the Chief Minister has asked the department to ensure that indigenous production and packaging is further scaled up to meet any eventuality. During a virtual Covid review meeting, CM Amarinder Singh on Monday directed the Health Department to step up indigenous manufacturing of medical oxygen to supplement the current supplies in order to ensure that there is no shortage of this critical commodity to tackle any future crisis due to Covid-19 spread. A government statement said, “As cases continue to spike, and amid reports of oxygen shortages in several parts of the country, the Chief Minister stressed the need to generate additional supplies through internal manufacturing also.” In line with this decision, the Health Department has so far issued license to one industrial oxygen supplier in Punjab to manufacture medical Oxygen, while six packaging units have been allowed to package oxygen for medical use. Amid reports of shortage of medical oxygen, Punjab has decided to step up its production in the state. Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan apprised the meeting that Punjab is following the 10-day discharge policy as per ICMR guidelines. .
