            "\n",
            "- **Historical Significance:** Advise the search to explore historical aspects, such as the era in which these mazars were constructed, their association with ancient Hindu texts or legends, and any historical events or figures linked to them. Keywords like \"ancient temples,\" \"historical landmarks,\" or \"religious heritage\" can be beneficial.\n",
