Context: A Twitter user shared the video and wrote, “In Moscow, Jewish shops are marked, in preparation for a possible pogrom tomorrow, and this, of course, reminds of other times. Following a call by former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal for global protests on October 13 in solidarity with Palestinians, a video surfaced on social media that showed a woman graffitiing the word “Mossad”, the name of the Israeli intelligence unit, leading to claims that Jewish shops in Moscow are being marked for a potential pogrom. The fact that the location includes a public infrastructure dismisses viral claims that the woman was marking Jewish businesses for an impending attack. Hamas called to attack Jews and Jewish businesses all over the world tomorrow.” India Today found that the viral video is at least four years old and unrelated to the recent Hamas-Israeli conflict.Our Probe A reverse search of keyframes from the viral video led us to a four-year-old post on the Russian social media platform VKontakte, with the caption “Israeli intelligence failure”. Though the woman's intentions for the graffiti remain unclear, social media users suggested the proximity of the Jewish Agency for Israel's office and a synagogue might have influenced her actions.The fact that the location includes a public infrastructure dismisses viral claims that the woman was marking Jewish businesses for an impending attack. .

Context: The direct outcome of modernisation of public schools in Kerala has been the rise in student admissions. “Government schools in Kerala have undergone a major facelift (with this programme),” said Sanuja A Shamsu, the headmistress of the Kongorpilly school, sitting inside a newly built staff room. On September 9, it was among 33 such schools, which have been physically transformed, inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through video-conferencing from Thiruvananthapuram as part of the ‘public education rejuvenation campaign’. In fact, at the Government Higher Secondary School in Kadayiruppu in the eastern suburbs of Ernakulam district, teachers and PTA officials plan to embark on a spirited campaign next year to attract students. The ‘public education rejuvenation campaign’ of the state government, which was part of the 2016 election manifesto of the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF), plans to turn 1,000 government schools into ‘centres of excellence’ by upgrading their physical infrastructure, improving pedagogy and adding technological weight to classrooms in the form of projectors, laptops and high-speed internet. .

Congress has directed its attention to the regional social media teams where tweets are posted in local languages. In fact, data suggests on 1st October when Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi decided to walk down to Hathras, the social media traffic crossed 1.1 million-mark on a single day which was a result of all organic traffic. .
