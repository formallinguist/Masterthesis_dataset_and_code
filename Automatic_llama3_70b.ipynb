Context:  Asserting that the people would vote for the BJP following the development works and good governance in the last five years, Raghubar Das said the BJP had won 14 assembly constituencies in the Kolhan region in the last polls. (Photo: IANS/PIB) As Jharkhand prepares for Assembly polls, Chief Minister Raghubar Das on Monday exuded confidence that he would notch up a historic win from Jamshedpur (East) seat following his five years of developmental works in the state. “I have full faith in the people of my constituency and I am very much confident that I will win with more than 1 lakh votes than the last election margin of 70,000,” Das said, without mentioning his opponent Saryu Roy, who is contesting as an Independent candidate from the same constituency. Asserting that the people would vote for the BJP following the development works and good governance in the last five years, Raghubar Das said the BJP had won 14 assembly constituencies in the Kolhan region in the last polls, “showing the BJPs strength in the region and in the state.” Our government has provided basic facilities such as roads, electricity and water, which were ignored since Independence.

Context: SNS | New Delhi | November 18, 2019 9:40 pm (Lakruwan WANNIARACHCHI / AFP) India will adopt a ”wait and watch” approach on Sri Lanka following the victory of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the presidential election even as it is hopeful that the new dispensation will not allow any foreign military asset (read China) in the island nation which could have implications for New Delhi’s strategic interests. Our two nations are bound by history and common beliefs and I look forward to strengthening our friendship and meeting you in the near future.” Advertisement The elder Rajapaksa, when he was the President, had greatly upset India when he allowed Chinese submarines to dock in Sri Lanka twice without informing India. New Delhi was quite certain for the past few months that Sri Lanka was moving towards a political transformation and the Rajapaksas could return to power in the wake of the gruesome Easter Sunday terror attacks in April. Though the Rajapaksas are seen as pro-China, officials in New Delhi believe the new Lankan leadership will not make any such strategic move that could impact India-Lanka ties. In a congratulatory message, Modi said: ”Congratulations Gotabaya Rajapaksa on your victory… I look forward to working closely with you for deepening the close and fraternal ties between our two countries and citizens, and for peace, prosperity as well as security in our region.” Modi also later telephoned the younger Rajapaksa and congratulated him. .

Context: New Delhi, July 4 The Bar Council of India (BCI), which regulates legal education in the country, has set up a seven-member committee to examine if Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) can be conducted in regional languages too. Currently, the CLAT is held in English for admission to 22 of the 23 national law universities. “The council being the regulator of legal education and legal profession, prima facie is of the view that no deserving candidate should be deprived from giving the CLAT on account of his/her inability to be proficient in English,” BCI Secretary Srimanto Sen said in a letter dated June 30 to petitioners who had moved the Delhi High Court, demanding the CLAT be held in regional languages. “…the knowledge or lack of English language does not determine ones intelligence, ability, acumen, dedication, IQ etc., therefore, prima-facie the exam should be conducted in vernacular languages too,” said the BCI. National Law University, Delhi, holds a separate admission test. . Claim:Bar council of india panel to examine if clat can be held in regional languages.\n",
