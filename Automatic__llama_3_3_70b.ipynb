Also add another line for justification from the given context only. Context: Former US President Barack Obama has said that modern day India can be counted as a success story in many respects, despite bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and corruption scandals. “In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, having survived repeated changeovers in government, bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and all manner of corruption scandals,” Obama writes. READ | Obama in his memoir: ‘(Dr Singh) looked frail…I wondered what would happen when he left office’ As the chief architect of India’s economic transformation, (former) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed like a fitting emblem of this progress: a member of the tiny, often persecuted Sikh religious minority who had risen to the highest office in the land, and a self-effacing technocrat who had won people’s trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt, says Obama, who had visited India twice as president in 2010 and 2015. Referring to his November 2010 India visit, Obama says he and Manmohan Singh had developed a warm and productive relationship. In his book “A Promised Land”, Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. .

Context: SNS | New Delhi | September 22, 2020 5:43 pm (Screengrab: Twitter/@loksabhatv) A day after the ruckus in the Rajya Sabha followed by the boycott of the House today, the opposition in the Lok Sabha also resorted to boycotting the House on the farm bill issue on Tuesday. This is highly unfortunate that it is being discussed now.” Earlier in the day, the Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in Rajya Sabha had declared that the opposition will boycott the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha till three key demands, including revoking of the suspension of eight members, are met. Yesterday, the eight suspended Rajya Sabha MPs had staged a sit-in protest near the Gandhi statue. The suspended MPs, despite several requests, refused to leave the premises resulting in halting the further proceedings inside the House. Soon, they protested on the lawns of the Parliament Complex. . Claim:Opposition members boycott lok sabha proceedings in protest against farm bills, suspension of rajya sabha mps.\n",

Biegun also made it clear that the security partnerships the United States and its partners explore today do not necessarily need to follow the model of the last century of mutual defence treaties with a heavy in-country presence of US troop. Biegun said: “As the United States assesses our own interests and how they intersect with India’s, we have seen the conditions emerge for an organic and deeper partnership — not an alliance on the post-war model, but a fundamental alignment along shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests, and shared values.” Stressing that the US post-World War II Pacific treaty alliances contributed to security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific for seven decades, he said, “But I should also be clear that the security partnerships the United States and our partners explore today do not necessarily need to follow the model of the last century of mutual defence treaties with a heavy in-country US troop presence. .
